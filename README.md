# Rocky.js REPL

Super quick and dirty hacked up REPL, implemented entirely using the Rocky.js public API :)

## Set up

- Run `npm install` in the `server` directory to install dependencies.

## Usage

- Run in one terminal: `pebble build && pebble install --emulator chalk --logs`
- Run in a second terminal: `node server/index.js`
- As soon as the app is launched, the REPL will be available in the second terminal.
